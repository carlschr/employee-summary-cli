# Employee Summary Generator
## About the Project
The purpose of this project was to develop a command line application that could be used to generate an html page displaying information about a software development team.
The templates for each team member and the javascript that generates the team.html file using the templates were provided for me.
My assignment was to create classes representing each team member type and create and prompts to take in user input.
